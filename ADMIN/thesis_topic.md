## Project Description

The objective of this thesis is to design and implement a **user-friendly form** for creating **RML (RDF Mapping Language)** mappings, using **SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)** both as a form definition language and as a validation mechanism.

RML is widely used for mapping data from various formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.) to **RDF**, enabling the integration of heterogeneous data sources into **knowledge graphs**. However, manually writing RML mappings can be complex and error-prone, especially for users without expertise in RDF or RML syntax.  

In this project, the student will:
- Define the structure and constraints of valid RML mappings in SHACL.
- Develop or extend a tool that utilizes these SHACL shapes to automatically generate a user-friendly form.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze existing tools** that use SHACL to generate forms and identify the one best suited for RML and its peculiarities (e.g., nested structure, reusable elements).  
2. **Design and implement a SHACL shapes graph** that accurately models RML mappings and can be interpreted by the chosen tool to generate the form.  
3. Since RML is made up of several modules, **develop a strategy** that allows the form to be configured to generate mappings for only a selected set of RML modules, depending on the user’s needs.
